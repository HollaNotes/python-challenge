# Module 3 Challenge - Python

**## PyBank**

*PyBank Instructions:*

*In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".*

   -*The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes*

   -*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period*

   -*The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period*



**## PyPoll**

*PyPoll Instructions:*

*In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.*

*You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:*

o	(PyBank and PyPoll) Helped with formatting
o	(PyBank and PyPoll) Taught me uppercase path for constant and how to link file so it shows correctly in terminal. 
o	Lines 13 and 33) Taught me about “if not none” and None
o	PyBank line 59, PyPoll line 55 - Showed be better way to output information
